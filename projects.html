                <li>Designed an app using Android Studio and Java to record motion sensor data.</li>
                <li>The app enables therapists to design stretches with their clients using Notch motion sensors which are lightweight, Bluetooth sensors that fit easily onto the body and pair with any mobile device.</li>
                <li>At home, the client is given audio and visual feedback to complete their exercises alone and data such as skips used and time to complete is returned to the therapist, so they may adjust ranges of motion as needed for their client.</li>
